        <h2>History of Red Star</h2>
        <img src="Images/MastersSquad.jpg" alt="Team Photo" width="500" height="400" style="float: right; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-left:10px; margin-bottom: 10px; border: solid black 1px; padding: 2px; max-width: 35%"> 
        <p>Red Star F.C was formed in December 1967 by a group of young men who were students of De La Salle College who wished to have a club of their own. This was an ambitious group who were looking for a ground and at first used a ground in a field owned by Milo Kelly, situated where Farran Park is today before moving to Woodstown where they rented a pitch from John Mooney for over 10 years. This pitch served the club well before moving to the grounds we occupy to this day in Ballytruckle, Waterford. Amongst the founder members and early stalwarts were  Jerry Owens, Paddy Murphy, Sonny Walsh, Martin Higgins, Henry Higgins , Gerry Ryan, Henry Randolph and William Egan to name just a few.</p>
        <p>The Club now in Ballytruckle has been run over the last 40 years by committed members, Michael Duffy (President Red Star F.C.), Tom Casey (Treasurer), Barry Byrne (Chairman), Brian Jones (Vice Chairman) and a group of other dedicated volunteers, managers, coaches and players who give their time to the development and running of this great club.</p>

        <p>In 2017, the Club formed a dedicated Schoolboy Committee under the leadership of Patrick Ruddle and Head of Coaching, Donal Denton. Great strides have already been made by this group including an enjoyable trip to Kilenny to Evergreen F.C with our academy, hopefully the first of many such trips.</p>

        <p> The club has won a league titles across numerous divisions including 7 Premier Titles - 1978, 1979, 1984, 1999, 2009, 2014 and 2016, 3 Munster Junior Cups - 1984, 2009 and 2016 and a Munster Youth Cup in 2009 since its inception. However our biggest milestone was achieved in 2016, when our Premier Squad won the FAI Cup, defeating Dublin powerhouse Sheriff FC amongst great excitement in the Aviva.</p>

        <p>International honours for players have been plentiful and include Walther Hughes and Oisin King receiving full international caps. Other honours went to Billy O'Neill, Miles Keevers, Barry Barrett and Pascal Carey in more recent times.</p>
